# ArticleIQ - Smart News Research Assistant üîç

ArticleIQ is an AI-powered tool designed to assist with researching and analyzing news articles. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models, Langchain and vector search technology, ArticleIQ provides insightful answers to your questions based on the content of the provided news articles.

## Project Description

ArticleIQ utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive web interface where users can input URLs of news articles they want to analyze. It processes the text of these articles using the LangChain library, which includes components such as OpenAI for language modeling, UnstructuredURLLoader for data loading, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for text splitting, and FAISS for vector storage and search. The tool creates vector embeddings with either OpenAI or HuggingFace's Instruct embeddings, and uses a retrieval-based question-answering system to provide users with precise answers and sources for further reading.

**The main libraries and technologies used in this project include:**

- Streamlit: For creating the interactive web interface.
- LangChain: To facilitate the construction of the retrieval-based QA chain.
- OpenAI: Providing access to powerful language models for text generation and embedding.
- HuggingFace Transformers: For alternative language model embeddings if desired.
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): For efficient similarity search and retrieval of text chunks.
- Python's Pickle: For saving and loading the FAISS vector index.
- dotenv: For loading environment variables securely.
